This is Corp Suite

The project I've been working on for my graduation defence.

Feel free to use the provided docker-compose file in order to run the whole project locally on your computer including the microservice and database!

Once the project is running you can access it on the following address: http://localhost:8080/

If you don't feel adventurous enough you can also access the platform on the following address: https://corp-suite.com/
